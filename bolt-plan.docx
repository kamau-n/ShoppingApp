I've created the foundation for the multi-tenant system. Here's what's been implemented:

Database Schema:
Added business_profiles table for business accounts
Updated users table with role and business relationship
Modified products table to associate with businesses
User Roles:
Admin: Full system access
Business: Can manage their products after subscription
Customer: Can browse products and get quotations
Registration Flow:
Users can choose between business and customer accounts
Business accounts are directed to a payment page
Customers get immediate access
Business Subscription Plans:
Basic: KSH 1,000/month
Pro: KSH 2,500/month
Enterprise: KSH 5,000/month
Next steps would be to:

Create the quotation system for customers
Add business-specific product pages
Implement admin dashboard
Add subscription management
Would you like me to implement any of these next steps?
